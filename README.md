## Publicity text

:construction: to be translated

Finally the time has come to show that you are a little genious!
At this hackathon you'll compete with a team to develop the coolest
game from scratch in only four hours! 
To make it even harder, some team members cannot even code, so be
ready to teach them! Or: if you cannot code yet, no worries, but
you'd better learn fast!
There is a price, eternal glory and -more important-
there will be pizza!
