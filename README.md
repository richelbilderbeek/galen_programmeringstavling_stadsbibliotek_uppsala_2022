## Evaluation

There were 19 participants, 7 of which from UMS.

![](programmeringsdag_usb_2022.jpg)

What we observed:

 * The day went smoothly, with enough volunteers being present
   and good enough presentation
 * At that day, the UMS participants were not experienced enough
   to really work together: code was copied using Discord or
   USB stick. Next time, the UMS participants will be better versed.
 * As the UMS participants were not well versed in working together yet,
   not all team members could contribute. On the other hand, all
   participants could do things fitting a Programming Day.
 * At the start of the day, the parents were told that there would
   be a presentation at 15:30. Although this idea popped up late,
   many parents should up anyways
 * It could be argued that 150 kroners per participant (i.e. the pizza and
   drinks) is quite expensive. 
 * Unexpectedly, participants could take a free book from the library.
   This opportunity was used by some participants, especially the older ones
 * There was a group of two 10-year-old and three 15-year-old. 
   This age difference gap was no problems, as both age groups respected one
   another
 * Some kids found it cool to drink the most fizzy drinks

What could be improved:

 * We should use a bigger room, so all participants can join:
   we had to say 'no' to some, as it was full
 * Have better flyers for the UMS courses
 * Let the parents know beforehand there is a presentation
 * Have a mechanism against the fizzy drinks competition
